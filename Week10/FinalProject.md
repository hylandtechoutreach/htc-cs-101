# Final 3 weeks: Project time!
Show us what you learned!

The first 2 weeks are for you to create your projects, what specifically you create is up to you! Examples in the past are Hangman, Create your own story, Mad-lib generators, simple databases with menu options, and rock paper scissors! All we ask is that you follow these required objectives:
- Use a loop! Can be `for`, `foreach` or `while`. Up to you!
- Use at least one method, show us you understand how to use them
- If your project would benefit from a `List`, use one!

## Expectations
- You should work individually on your projects. A little help is okay, but you should not be copying and pasting code from anywhere (internet or other students)
- You will present your project on the last day of club! The presentation can be brief, but should cover the following:
	- A demonstration of your program in action
	- An explanation of the loop and method used
	- Anything you think is worth noting about the development process

Good luck!
